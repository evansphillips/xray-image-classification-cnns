# X-ray Image Classification for Lung Diseases


## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify X-ray images of lung scans into three categories: normal patients, bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia. The primary goal is to leverage deep learning techniques to achieve accurate classification and explore various strategies to optimize model performance.

## Dataset

- The dataset comprises X-ray images of lung scans from patients with normal lungs, bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia.
- Dataset source: [Provide source or citation if applicable]

## Project Objectives

- **Image Classification**: Create a CNN model capable of accurately classifying X-ray images into three categories.
- **Experimentation**: Experiment with different techniques to improve model performance, including:
  - Padding strategies
  - Dropout layers
  - Batch normalization
  - Stride variations

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Preparation**: Preprocess and organize the X-ray image data, including resizing, data augmentation, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

- **Model Architecture**: Define the CNN architecture, incorporating various techniques such as padding, dropout, batch normalization, and strides to optimize performance.

- **Training**: Train the model using the training dataset, and monitor metrics like loss and accuracy on the validation set.

- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its generalization performance.

- **Experimentation**: Experiment with different hyperparameters and architectural modifications to find the best configuration for improving validation accuracy and minimizing loss.

- **Results**: Document and present the results of different experiments, including model performance metrics and visualizations.
